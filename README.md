Adventure!
===================

Adventure! is an Android app and web app designed to set and retrieve location aware notes.  Using the Android app, you can drop text, voice, or image notes at a given geographic location.  Other phones running the app will see that note only when they are near that location.  Using the web app, you can see all notes presented as pins on a Google map, and add notes that will be seen by people who travel near the specified locations.

Possible uses include:
* Leaving notes for friends/loved ones
* Digital scavenger hunt
* Reminders that you will encounter throughout the day
* Reminders to do something when you get to a specific location (like when you get into the office, or when you get into class)
* Location aware advertising

Future features include:
* iOS client
* expiring notes
* private notes
* a more formal scavenger hunt game

This was the 3rd place winner in the Spring 2014 GIT MAD app-a-thon, at Georgia Tech College of Computing.  The team included:
